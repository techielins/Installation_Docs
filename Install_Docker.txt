This document contains the steps to install Docker on CentOS 7 based server.

Docker is an application that makes it simple and easy to run application processes in a container, which are like virtual machines

Step 1 — Installing Docker

To get the latest and greatest version, install Docker from the official Docker repository.

~]# sudo yum check-update

Now run this command. It will add the official Docker repository, download the latest version of Docker, and install it:

~]# curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

After installation has completed, start the Docker daemon:

~]# sudo systemctl start docker

Verify that it’s running:

~]# sudo systemctl status docker

The output should be similar to the following, showing that the service is active and running:

● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-07-09 11:57:50 UTC; 54s ago
     Docs: https://docs.docker.com
 Main PID: 5474 (dockerd)
    Tasks: 10
   Memory: 41.9M
   CGroup: /system.slice/docker.service
           └─5474 /usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock

Lastly, make sure it starts at every server reboot:

~]# sudo systemctl enable docker
