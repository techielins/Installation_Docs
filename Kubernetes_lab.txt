This file contains the installation docs/practices that were followed during Kubernetes training.


In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to install and use it on an existing installation of CentOS 7.

Installing Docker

~]# sudo yum check-update

$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

$ sudo systemctl start docker

$ sudo systemctl status docker



Excercise :

Create a folder inside home directory docker

$ mkdir -p docker

Installing Flask on CentOS 7

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. 

Install Python 3 and venv
Install Python 3.6 from the Software Collections (SCL) repositories as the default version of Python on CentOS 7 is Python 2.7.5. SCL allows you to install newer versions of python 3.x alongside the default python v2.7.5

$ sudo yum install centos-release-scl

Once the repository is enabled install Python 3.6 with the command below:

$ sudo yum install rh-python36

Creating a Virtual Environment

$ mkdir flask
$ python3 -m venv venv

The directory venv created will contain a copy of the Python binary, the Pip package manager, the standard Python library and other supporting files.

Next, activate the virtual environment using the activate script by issuing the command below:

$ source venv/bin/activate

Install Flask

$ pip install Flask


Running a container using Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile inside docker folder

$ cd docker

$ cat Dockerfile
FROM python:2.7-onbuild
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "python , "http_serv.py" ]

$ cat requirements.txt
Flask
